# NVIM config

Custom NVIM config based of the following principle:

- As simple as acceptable (by me) and easy to maintain and upgrad
- Use latest stable release
- Inclusion of few essential plugins for QOA (nvim-lsp-config for example) only
- Custom logic can be implemented manually as a tool for better learning how nvim works

## Improvement methodology

The way the config will evolve is simple : Make changes when needed or when expected behavior are not met.

The following are good example:
- Switch to nativa package managment, since it accepts config reloading
- Auto-match quotes and other elements that comes into pairs
- ...
